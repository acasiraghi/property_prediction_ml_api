# property_prediction_end_to_end

This repository contains an ongoing project used to apply specific libraries in a practical codebase. The project focuses on end-to-end development, including backend logic, API design and GUI integration.

The goal is to implement an end-to-end solution for the prediction of molecular properties:

- a workflow for model selection
- a workflow for model training and evaluation
- a prediction pipeline for inference
- an interactive GUI for uploading data and visualizing prediction results
- an API connecting the GUI and the prediction pipeline

In the current version, models and associated metrics are just placeholders. Model performance has not been optimized or evaluated and predictions are not reliable.
